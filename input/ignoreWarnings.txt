# 22 This warning will be fixed in a later release of the IG Publisher - see last messages in this Zulip thread: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/196008-ig-publishing-requirements/topic/how.20to.20fix.20these.20warnings
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/endpoint-connection-type'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '2.1.1', found versions: 1.0.0, 2.1.1. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/endpoint-connection-type' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/endpoint-connection-type|2.1.1'
