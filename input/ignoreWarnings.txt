# 03 US Core 6.1.0 is the version that is cited in regulation for 2026, the next release of the US Public Health Profiles Library will move to the next cited release of US Core
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered
