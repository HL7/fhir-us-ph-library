It is based on the [US Core Simple Observation Profile]({{site.data.fhir.ver.hl7fhiruscore}}/StructureDefinition-us-core-simple-observation.html) profile and further constrains it:
* sets Observation.category to "disability-status | disability status"
* binds Observation.code to Disability Status Assessment value set
* further constrains Observation.subject to the [US Public Health Patient](StructureDefinition-us-ph-patient.html)
* binds Observation.value\[x\] to the Yes/No/Unknown/Not asked value set

The six item set of questions used on ACS and other major surveys to gauge disability is the data standard for survey questions on disability. Note the age thresholds for survey participants for the different disability questions.
