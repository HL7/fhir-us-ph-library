It is based on the [US Core Simple Observation Profile]({{site.data.fhir.ver.hl7fhiruscore}}/StructureDefinition-us-core-simple-observation.html) profile and further constrains it:
* sets Observation.category\[us-core\] to "social-history | social history"
* sets Observation.category\[exposure\] to "TRNS | exposure"
* binds to example value sets for use in Observation.code
* further constrains Observation.subject to the [US Public Health Patient](StructureDefinition-us-ph-patient.html)

Profile Use Guidance: 
* Observation.extension\[address\]: if known, an address where the exposure/contact took place
* Observation.code: The type of exposure/contact (environmental, activity, event, location, person, animal, etc.). 
* Observation.focus: A reference to a Patient, RelatedPerson, Location, Group, etc. when the exposure/contact is an entity (person, animal, location)
    * an animal would be represented by a RelatedPerson that contains the Extension Practitioner Animal Species. 
* Observation.valueString: free text information about the exposure/contact
* Observation.effective\[x\]: the date or period of exposure
* Observation.component: the possible agent of concern in the exposure

The following are some exposures that might be captured in this profile:

* Environmental exposures
    * Living facilities
    * Work facilities
    * School facilities
* Contact exposures
    * Person
